Hay My name is Muhammed, which goes under code name ManaMiner in case the need to own a signature. Anyways, Nice to see you here! Let me explain a bit more about myself and how I got to where I am now.

I’m a mechanical engineer graduate who’s passionate about data science, statistics and machine learning.

Took my bachelor’s degree from Egypt and currently working in Dubai as Jr.data analyst by day and making simple personal content here by night !

I like to save and document my journey of evolving personal projects and taking them to the next levels.

I have a little artistic personality so my visualizations are made with care !
